## About this Solution
This solution is designed to help developers learn and get started quickly with XMCLoud + SXA.

It is done from a default Foundation Head staterkit, plus I added useful features to is above the default:

- authoring API that creates a Media item out of an image from a local drive
- authenication and other security/token scripts to be re-used by other scripts, that reliy on `user.json` file
- enablement of SPE module and its remoting (including the Win PS module itself within `SPE.zip`)
- sample of operable XDT transform
- a basic example of customization (Expander/Collapser for Content Editor)
- build and deploy scripts
- deployment to Vercel script
